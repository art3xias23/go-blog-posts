<p>I started using a tool I hadn't used in some time and wanted to share it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My PC gets quite hot during the summer months and if I have 2 instances of VS open, 10 tabs on my browser and I suddenly need to check something on SSMS I start getting cold sweats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where tools like &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-utility?view=sql-server-ver16"&gt;sqlcmd&lt;/a&gt; and mssql-cli come in.</p>
<p class="ck-editor-image-container">&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I never liked the output of sqlcmd and no matter how I tweak the settings it's still not nice to look at.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I found <a href="https://github.com/dbcli/mssql-cli/blob/main/doc/usage_guide.md"</a></p>
<ul>
    <li>It provides autocompletion which can be toggled on and off</li>
    <li>It provides a nice readable format</li>
    <li>It provides a multiline input style which can be toggled on and off</li>
    <li>and it also provides a nice way to scroll vertically through columns with the arrow keys</li>
    <li>
        <p>and much much more</p>
        <p><br>&nbsp;</p>

    </li>
</ul>
